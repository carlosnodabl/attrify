# Attrify for Marketing Attribution

Attrify saves a user's initial-and-last, referrer and campaign (utm) query string parameters as cookies. Initial values are saved for ever and last are persisted for the length of the users browsing session. The cookies can then be passed to your marketing automation system, CRM, or email marketing system at any time during the users session for enhanced marketing attribution.

By default, only the `initial_referrer` `initial_utm_campaign`, `initial_utm_source`, `initial_utm_medium`, `initial_utm_content`, and `initial_utm_term`, `referrer` `utm_campaign`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` are saved. Extra query string parameters can also be saved by passing them in via the `options.params` object. If the query string contains any of the parameters to be saved, a new session is assumed and previously set cookies will be overwritten. Initial value cookies are not overwritten at any time.

`attrify()` should be called on each page view and all pages of your site.

Note: This is currently a browser only module because it reads the query string from `window.location.search` and sets cookies via `document.cookie`. It could however be easily be modified to run as an express middleware and work on the server side.

Attrify is a fork and improvement of my previous project [Last Campaign](https://github.com/Yesware/last-campaign).

## Installation & Usage

### NPM
`$ npm install attrify --save` OR `$ yarn add attrify`

```
var attrify = require('attrify');
attrify();
```

### Bower
`$ bower install attrify`

```
attrify();
```

## Options

### `timeout` (Number)

Default session timeout in minutes. This should match the session timeout used in Google Analyutcs. Default `30`

Passing in `null` will disable the session timeout and revert to using a session cookie. E.g. `timeout: null`

### `prefix` (String)

Global cookie name prefix. Default `''`

### `initialPrefix` (String)

Initial cookie name prefix. Default `'initial_'`

### `lastPrefix` (String)

Session cookie name prefix. Default `''`

### `params` (Array)

An array of additional query string parameters to save. E.g. `['gclid']`.

### `data` (Object)

An object of additional values to save. Values are only saved once per session.

### `defaults` (Boolean)

Specify if the default parameters, `initial_utm_campaign`, `initial_utm_source`, `initial_utm_medium`, `initial_utm_content`, `initial_utm_term`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` should be saved. Default `true`

### `domain` (String)

Specify a domain to set cookie on. If you want this to work across all of your sub-domains, set this to your domain name prefixed with a period. E.g. `.google.com`

Default `null`

### `path` (String)

Cookie path.

Default `/`

## Examples

### Save `gclid` AdWords ID in addition to default parameters
```
attrify({
    params: ['gclid']
});
```

### Save only the `foo` parameter with an `_` prefix
```
attrify({
    prefix: '_',
    defaults: false,
    params: ['foo']
});
```

### Save `foo` value in addition to default parameters
```
attrify({
    data: {
        foo: 'bar'
    }
});
```
